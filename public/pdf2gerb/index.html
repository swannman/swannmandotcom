            <h1>pdf2gerb: Convert PDF to Gerber and NC Drill formats</h1>
            <div class="highlightbox">New! Version 1.6 is a massive update courtesy of DJ. The tool now auto-generates soldermask and outline layers, supports polygon fills, can read compresed PDF 1.4 format, and is much more robust. It also has proper documentation — <a href="https://github.com/swannman/pdf2gerb/raw/master/docs/Pdf2Gerb.pdf">read it here.</a> Thanks DJ!</div>
            <p>I prefer to design circuit board layouts in Adobe Illustrator — it's a familiar tool and I get results quickly.  PCB manufacturers expect designs in Gerber + NC Drill format, however, and the best Illustrator can do is export to PDF.</p>
            <p>pdf2gerb is a Perl script that converts specially-formatted PDF files to Gerber and NC Drill format.  I used it to order PCB designs from BatchPCB for my <a href="https://swannman.com/povclock/">POV clock</a> with great success.</p>
            <h3>Converting PDF to Gerber</h3>
            <p>The PDF and Gerber file formats are very similar.  PDF commands move a pen from point to point, drawing lines and changing stroke weights.  Similarly, Gerber commands move a photoplotter head around a circuit board, exposing lines and changing apertures.  The concept is the same but the grammar is different.</p>
            <p>For example, the PDF command "350 450 m" moves the pen to coordinate (350, 450).  The Gerber equivalent is "X350Y450D02".  ".5 w" changes the PDF stroke weight; "G54D10" changes the Gerber aperture.</p>
            <p>pdf2gerb reads a PDF file line-by-line, converting each command to its Gerber equivalent.</p>
            <h3>Converting PDF to NC Drill</h3>
            <p>An NC (aka Excellon) Drill file specifies drill coordinates and diameters for the circuit board. In my PDF file, I represent each drill hole as a solid white circle placed atop the corresponding solder pad (a solid black circles).</p>
            <p>pdf2gerb looks for filled white circles in a PDF and outputs their coordinates and diameters as NC Drill commands.</p>
            <h3>Multi-layer boards</h3>
            <p>pdf2gerb creates a Gerber and NC Drill file for each layer in the PDF file.  Simply draw the board in Illustrator using multiple layers as though you were looking top-down through the board with x-ray vision.</p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Here is a double-sided board I drew in Illustrator and converted with pdf2gerb:
            <div class="photo center"><a href="165623154_Zixr9-L.jpg"><img src="165623154_Zixr9-M.jpg" /></a></div></p>
            <p>...and here's the board I received from BatchPCB:
            <div class="photo center"><a href="196513727-L.jpg"><img src="196513727-M.jpg" /></a></div></p>
            <p>Here's how I prepared the board — 
            <ol><li>Did a rough layout of the board on graph paper</li>
                <li>Redrew the layout in Illustrator:
                <ul>
                    <li>Created several layers: Top Copper, Bottom Copper, Top Silkscreen, Soldermask, and Drill.</li>
                    <li>Drew holes in the Drill layer as a solid black circle (for the pad) with a solid white circle on top (for the drill location and diameter)</li>
                    <li>Used the pen tool on the Top and Bottom layers to add traces between pads</li>
                    <li>Drew solid black circles in the Soldermask layer to cover each pad</li>
                    <li>Drew a rectangle around the board in the Silkscreen layer</li></ul></li>
                <li>Copied the Drill layer into top and bottom layers (may not have been necessary)</li>
                <li>Exported the layout in PDF format:
                <ul>
                    <li>Selected PDF 1.3 format</li>
                    <li>Unchecked "Preserve Illustrator Editing Capabilities"</li>
                    <li>Unchecked "Embed Page Thumbnails"</li>
                    <li>On the Compression page, unchecked "Compress Text and Line Art"</li></ul></li>
                <li>Ran 'pdf2gerb.pl /path/to/circuit.pdf'</li>
                <li>Renamed 'Top Copper.drd' to 'Drill.drd'</li>
                <li>Made a .zip file of Top Copper.grb, Bottom Copper.grb, Top Silkscreen.grb, Soldermask.grb, and Drill.drd</li>
                <li>Submitted the .zip file to BatchPCB</li>
            </ol>
             
            You can download the files from this project <a href="https://github.com/swannman/pdf2gerb/raw/master/examples/pdf2gerb_example.zip">here</a>.</p>
            <div class="highlightbox">Curious whether this tool works?  It's been proven in real-world use — I used it to design three circuit boards for my <a href="https://swannman.com/povclock/">discrete logic POV clock</a>, and <a href="https://www.lucaderosso.com/">Luca De Rosso</a> used it to design the board for his OTOH project.</div>
            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>Download the script <a href="https://raw.github.com/swannman/pdf2gerb/master/pdf2gerb.pl">here.</a>  Right-click on the download link and save it to your computer.  Open a Terminal window, navigate to the file you downloaded, and type <span class="code">chmod 755 pdf2gerb.pl</span> to make it executable.</p>
            <p>To use pdf2gerb, type <span class="code">./pdf2gerb.pl /path/to/circuit.pdf</span>.  Gerber and NC Drill files will be output to the same location as the PDF file.</p>

            <h3>Version history</h3>
            <p><strong>1.6:</strong> Massive update courtesy of DJ — now auto-generates an outline and soldermask, supports compression and polygon fills, and has proper documentation.</p>
            <p><strong>1.4:</strong> Improved support for CMYK input files.  Change drill file format to decimal (no leading/trailing zeroes suppression) to make the file easier to parse.</p>
            <p><strong>1.3:</strong> Added support for the 'v' and 'y' Bézier curve operators.  Download an example file with supported curves <a href="https://github.com/swannman/pdf2gerb/raw/master/examples/pdf2gerb_curve_test.zip">here.</a></p>
            <p><strong>1.2:</strong> Added a workaround for TurboCAD users who cannot create filled circles.  When TurboCAD support is enabled, pdf2gerb will interpret stroked circles as a drill hole and copper pad as shown in <a href="https://github.com/swannman/pdf2gerb/raw/master/turbocad_strokemode.png">this diagram</a>.  The default stacked-filled-circles approach is still preferred, as it gives you the most control over hole and pad size.</p>
            <p><strong>1.1:</strong> Improved compatibility with Illustrator CS3, which uses the <em>cm</em> command to transform the coordinate plane. Also approximate Bézier curves as two straight lines rather than ignoring them.</p>
